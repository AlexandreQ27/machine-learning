    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you have explored what regression is with sample data gathered from the pumpkin pricing dataset that we will use throughout this lesson. You have also visualized it using Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are ready to dive deeper into regression for Machine Learning. While visualization allows you to make sense of data, the real power of Machine Learning comes from _training models_. Models are trained on historical data to automatically capture data dependencies, and they allow you to predict outcomes for new data, which the model has not seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn more about two types of regression: _basic linear regression_ and _polynomial regression_, along with some of the math underlying these techniques. Those models will allow us to predict pumpkin prices depending on different input data.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Throughout this curriculum, we assume minimal knowledge of math, and seek to make it accessible for students coming from other fields, so watch for notes, callouts, diagrams, and other learning tools to aid in comprehension.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be familiar by now with the structure of the pumpkin data that we are examining. You can find it preloaded and pre-cleaned in this section's [linear and polynomial regression.ipynb](../../assignments/ml-fundamentals/linear-and-polynomial-regression.ipynb) file. In the file, the pumpkin price is displayed per bushel in a new data frame.  Make sure you can run these notebooks in kernels in Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, you are loading this data so as to ask questions about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When is the best time to buy pumpkins? \n",
    "- What price can I expect of a case of miniature pumpkins?\n",
    "- Should I buy them in half-bushel baskets or by the 1 1/9 bushel box?\n",
    "Let's keep digging into this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, you created a Pandas data frame and populated it with part of the original dataset, standardizing the pricing by bushel. By doing that, however, you were only able to gather about 400 data points and only for the fall months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the data that we preloaded in this lesson's accompanying notebook. The data is preloaded and an initial scatterplot is charted to show monthly data. Maybe we can get a little more detail about the nature of the data by cleaning it more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A linear regression line\n",
    "\n",
    "As you learned in section 1, the goal of a linear regression exercise is to be able to plot a line to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Show variable relationships**. Show the relationship between variables\n",
    "- **Make predictions**. Make accurate predictions on where a new data point would fall in relationship to that line.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is typical of **Least-Squares Regression** to draw this type of line. The term 'least-squares' means that all the data points surrounding the regression line are squared and then added up. Ideally, that final sum is as small as possible, because we want a low number of errors or `least-squares``.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do so since we want to model a line that has the least cumulative distance from all of our data points. We also square the terms before adding them since we are concerned with their magnitude rather than their direction.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{seealso}\n",
    "**Show me the math** \n",
    " \n",
    "This line, called the _line of best fit_ can be expressed by [an equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression):  \n",
    "\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> Y = a + bX\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "`X` is the 'explanatory variable'. `Y` is the 'dependent variable'. The slope of the line is `b` and `a` is the y-intercept, which refers to the value of `Y` when `X = 0`. \n",

    "\n",
    "First, calculate the slope `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, and referring to our pumpkin data's original question: \"predict the price of a pumpkin per bushel by month\", `X` would refer to the price and `Y` would refer to the month of sale.\n",

    "Calculate the value of Y. If you're paying around $4, it must be April!\n",
    "\n",
    "The math that calculates the line must demonstrate the slope of the line, which is also dependent on the intercept, or where `Y` is situated when `X = 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can observe the method of calculation for these values on the [Math is Fun](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/least-squares-regression.html) website. Also, visit [this Least-squares calculator](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/least-squares-calculator.html) to watch how the numbers' values impact the line.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "## Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "One more term to understand is the **Correlation Coefficient** between given X and Y variables. Using a scatterplot, you can quickly visualize this coefficient. A plot with data points scattered in a neat line has a high correlation, but a plot with data points scattered everywhere between X and Y has a low correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good linear regression model will be one that has a high (nearer to 1 than 0) Correlation Coefficient using the Least-Squares Regression method with a line of regression.\n",
