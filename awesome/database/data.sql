We introduce both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches to key problems, comparing and contrasting their power and limitations. We seek to enable students to evaluate a wide variety of solutions to key problems we face in this rapidly developing field, and to execute on new enabling solutions that can have large impact. As part of the subject students will implement solutions to challenging problems, first in problem sets that span a carefully chosen set of tasks, and then in an independent project. Students will program using Python 3 and TensorFlow 2 in Jupyter Notebooks, a nod to the importance of carefully documenting your work so it can be precisely reproduced by others.',NULL,NULL,'Lecture 1'||X'09'

Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in neural network (aka “deep learning”) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course is a deep dive into the details of deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement and train their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. Additionally, the final assignment will give them the opportunity to train and apply multi-million parameter networks on real-world vision problems of their choice. Through multiple hands-on assignments and the final course project, students will acquire the toolset for setting up deep learning tasks and practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning deep neural networks.',NULL,NULL,'Tuesday/Thursday 12:00-1:20PM Pacific Time at NVIDIA Auditorium.','free',0,'Deep learning',NULL,'self-paced',NULL,'en_US','intermediate',NULL,'Spring 2023',1693449835907,'2023-08-31 02:43:55',NULL);

Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification and object detection. Recent developments in neural network approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course is a deep dive into details of neural-network based deep learning methods for computer vision. During this course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. We will cover learning algorithms, neural network architectures, and practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning networks for visual recognition tasks.","cover":null,"objectives":null,"syllabus":"Lecture 1 [Remote]\tWednesday January 5\tCourse Introduction Computer vision overview Historical context Course logistics\t[slides] [video (UMich

Reinforcement learning is one powerful paradigm for doing so, and it is relevant to an enormous range of tasks, including robotics, game playing, consumer modeling and healthcare. This class will provide a solid introduction to the field of reinforcement learning and students will learn about the core challenges and approaches, including generalization and exploration. Through a combination of lectures, and written and coding assignments, students will become well versed in key ideas and techniques for RL. Assignments will include the basics of reinforcement learning as well as deep reinforcement learning — an extremely promising new area that combines deep learning techniques with reinforcement learning.

Reinforcement learning is one powerful paradigm for doing so, and it is relevant to an enormous range of tasks, including robotics, game playing, consumer modeling and healthcare. This class will provide a solid introduction to the field of reinforcement learning and students will learn about the core challenges and approaches, including generalization and exploration. Through a combination of lectures, and written and coding assignments, students will become well versed in key ideas and techniques for RL. Assignments will include the basics of reinforcement learning as well as deep reinforcement learning — an extremely promising new area that combines deep learning techniques with reinforcement learning. In addition, students will advance their understanding and the field of RL through a final project.","syllabus":"Lecture\tJan 7\tIntroduction to Reinforcement Learning\t [Slides, Draft lecture notes] Additional Materials: High level introduction: SB (Sutton and Barton) Chp 1 Linear Algebra Review Probability Review python tutorial Lecture\tJan 9\tHow to act given know how the world works.
